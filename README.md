## Js-Quiz

### A website for learning Javascript

[**Demo**](https://js-quiz.me).


### server tech stack

-  TypeScript
-  Graphql api made with Apollo-Server
-  MongoDb database
-  Typogoose helping the integration between mongo, graphql and typescript
-  Redis for caching handling cookies and password resets

### client specific

-  TypeScript
-  Next.js
-  Chakra-ui components
-  Urql for querying my Graphql api
-  Graphql codegen for helping with typescript and generating react hooks
-  ace-builds for the code editor I used

In conclusion this tech stack worked well and I have to mention that client-side queries with Urql and the hooks that codegen generates is awesome!

### TODO
- Automated tests for atleast the server side.
